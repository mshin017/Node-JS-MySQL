# Node-JS-MySQL
In this app, I created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL. 
In the 'bamazonCustomer' app , it will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. This app can also track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
In the 'bamazonManager' app, it will allow you to access all of the store's inventory as well as viewing the items that need to be restocked and adding to it. And will be able to add new products to the store. 


Below is a video of a tutorial of the app:

This app is able to receive, update, and insert it's data using MySQL Databse. In the tutorial, it is seen that I have bought 5 Macbook Pros and also added a new product of hats.  In the pictures below, it shows what the databases looked like before and after I added new data.
